## 📖 Overview

**MedSense** is a Final Year Project (FYP) designed to revolutionize the patient experience in clinics. It addresses the common problem of unpredictable waiting times and lack of support for vulnerable patients.

By leveraging **Artificial Intelligence**, MedSense predicts waiting times dynamically. Uniquely, it prioritizes inclusivity with dedicated features for **OKU (Persons with Disabilities)**, ensuring equitable access to healthcare services.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 AI-Powered Estimations:** Uses historical data and real-time inputs to provide accurate waiting time predictions for patients.
* **♿ OKU-Friendly:** Specialized interface and priority queue logic for disabled (OKU) users and the elderly.
* **📱 Real-Time Queue Tracking:** Patients can track their queue status remotely via the mobile app, reducing congestion in the clinic.
* **🔔 Smart Notifications:** Push notifications alert patients when their turn is approaching.
* **📊 Clinic Admin Dashboard:** A web/tablet view for staff to manage queues, doctors, and patient flow efficiently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
* **Backend:** [Your Backend, e.g., Firebase / Node.js / Laravel]
* **AI/ML:** [Your AI Tech, e.g., Python / TensorFlow / Scikit-learn for time prediction]
